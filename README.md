## Live App

https://git-hub-autocomplete-search.vercel.app/

## Setup

To run this app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/L3VU5/GitHub-Autocomplete-Search.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd GitHub-Autocomplete-Search`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the application: `npm run start`

If `npm run start` results in error - run `npm run build` command first and re-run.

## Additional Setup

To successfuly make GitHub requests, you'll need to provide GitHub API key.

You can modify the `next.config.mjs` file as follows:

```
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  env: {
    NEXT_PUBLIC_REACT_APP_GITHUB_API_KEY:
      "YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

More about GitHub authentication and how to generate access token in here:

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens

You can also contact me and I'll provide the key.
